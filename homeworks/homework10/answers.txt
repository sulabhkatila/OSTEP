1 -> Done!

2 -> The biggest program is of unit 929, so the limit value should be, minimally, 930.

3 -> Add the total size of all 10 programs and substract the resulting value from 16k.

4 -> Ok.

5 -> As bounds get bigger the valid programs get smaller, and will limit at one (because programs won't be bigger than the physical memory).
