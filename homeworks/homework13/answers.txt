1 -> Increase in address space means there is an increase in pages to keep track of resulting in larger page-table size.
As the page size grows, the number of pages decreses, which means the page table size decreases.
Not use big pages in general because it can lead to internal fragmentation.


2 -> As we increase the percentage of pages that are allocated in each address space, the page table size increases and so does the number of valid memory accesses.


3 -> Having 256m address space, and 1m of page size while having just 512m physical memory is unrealistic because a huge portion of the addresses will be invalid.


4 -> The program will refuse to run "Error: physical memory size must be GREATER than address space size (for this simulation)".
