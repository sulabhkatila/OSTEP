1 -> gettimeofday() measures in microseconds. An operation has to take at least 1 microsecond to be measured individually.


2 -> Done!


3 -> Tried in in a single machine (Mac). The access time, interestingly, seem to decrease as number of pages increase.


4 -> Used Matplitlib and numpy. Visualization helps see the trends and outliers.


5 -> Use -O0 flag. Updated the data and graph.


6 -> Can't seem to do it in mac.


7 -> Initialized to 0. Updated the code, data, and graph.
