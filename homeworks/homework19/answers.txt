The present of multiple threads will not change the calculation because context switch will always keep track of the register values.

There is no race condition in the code because the threads are not sharing any data.


3 -> Both threads will start will 3 and will decrement their and their only register value for every instruction to decrement.


4 -> Lets assume the initial value in the address was 0, then by third instruction it will be 1 and will stay till the death of the thread.


5 -> the initial value in bx is 3. The loop, in each iteration, decrements the value in bx by 1 and the condition for the loop is if "value in bx is not equal to 0". Hence, the loop runs 3 times.

The final value would be 6 for the shared resource.
