<Using lldb for gdb and leaks for valgrind>

1 -> Program seg faults, because of null pointer dereference.


2 -> lldb points to the exact line where the seg fault occured and the exact dereference that caused it.


3 -> No leaks detected.


4 -> Shows the total memory allocated dynamically and the totla memory that was leaked.


5 -> 816 bytes of memory leaked.


6 -> No memory leaks!


7 -> No, running the program provides the reson for exit. free probably checks if the pointer is pointing to heap memory or not, and exits if not.


8 -> Realloc is generally slower than the linkedlist verison.


9 -> Ok.
